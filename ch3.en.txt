This lesson by Harishankar Parsai is a strong condemnation of the ignorance, pride, selfishness and cheating prevalent in society. The criticism of Harishankar Parsai is generally scathing. Here, the author has considered criticism as one of the 'Navarasas'. He believes that everyone takes a dip in criticism and enjoys it. In his opinion, the greatness of criticism is unbeatable.

Once, the author had an unexpected visit from his friend. The friend spent hours talking nonsense and criticizing others and then left. The author had nothing to do with the people his friend criticized. Despite this, he continued to listen to his friend's criticism.

The author's friend was a strange man. He had a great collection of the vices of his acquaintances. He would criticize the vices of other people behind their back. Many people enjoyed his criticism.

The author says that one must assemble four or five critics (such as his friend), and listen to their commentary and discussion. They begin to criticize others with such gracefulness and entertaining language, that one does not feel like leaving such an atmosphere. Such critics consider themselves blessed to be able to criticize others. Criticizing others is like a tonic for them. This tonic increases their lifespan and strength.

There are associations of critics. These associations have presidents, vice-presidents and members, who actually hold these posts. These people are dedicated and involved in their work. The unity and style of functioning of critics' associations is unparalleled.

"Those who are victims of deprivation and weakness are the ones who begin to criticize others. Criticizing others does not benefit them in any way; however, these people take great pleasure in criticizing others.

The greatness of criticism is infinite; it is limitless. Therefore, one must not criticize critics. The great poet Surdas once said, "Ninda Sabada Rasaal", meaning that criticizing is equal to eating a sweet mango.
