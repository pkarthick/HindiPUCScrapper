The poet, Tulasidasji, says that he has complete faith in his beloved Lord Rama. He has only one source of strength, only one desire, and only one unbreakable faith in his master Lord Rama. He says that if Lord Rama is akin to rain (of the swati nakshatra), then he is like a 'chatak' bird (a kind of cuckoo which is supposed to drink only drops of rain).

Tulsi See The Idea, It Is Matu Prabin| 2.

Tulsidas Ji says that man should have a relationship with this world, that is, thirty-six (36) from worldly nature and the relationship of sixty-seven (63) with God. This means that even while living in the world, man should show indifference to the world and always express love for God.

Tulasidasji says that man must have a relationship of '36' with the world, i.e. with the worldly universe. With the almighty, however, man must establish a relationship of '63'. What this means is that, although living in a materialistic world like ours, one must show indifference towards the world and towards worldly pleasures. Towards the almighty, however, one must always show love.

Thirty-six – 36;
Six three – 63;

3) Tulsi Sant Suab Taru, Phuli-
It is the most fruitful, and they give fruit. 3.

Tulasidasji says that saints and godly men are like a mango tree. They are like the mango tree which flowers and bears fruits only for the sake of others. From the ground, when people throw stones at the mango tree, the tree showers them with fruit. Similarly, no matter how much a saint or godly man is insulted on this earth, he will always bless and wish well for the person who insults.

Suamb Taru – a mango tree filled with fruit;
on-the-same – for the benefit of others;

4) Tulsi physique is a field, Mansa Bhau Kisan.
Sin virtuous are dou seeds, buwe hundred lunai diagnostics. 4.

Tulsidas Ji says that our body is a field and the mind is a farmer and both sin and virtue are seeds. Thus, the kind of seed that is planted in the field is cultivated and the crop is received. Similarly, in the field of the body, the farmer of the mind puts the seeds of both sin and virtue. Whichever seed the farmer sows, he also bites the crop. That is, the mind of man is attracted to one of both sin and virtue. As we sow, we will receive the same fruitage, that is, the fruitage of good deeds will be bad for good and bad deeds.

Tulasidasji says that our body is like a farm, whereas our mind is like a farmer and sin and virtue are like seeds. Thus, whatever type of seed is sown in the farm, the produce of the farm will be of that quality. Similarly, in our body (which is like a farm), our mind (the farmer) sows seeds of both sin and virtue. Whichever seeds the mind nourishes and nurtures will grow and yield produce. What the poet is implying is that the human mind is attracted to either sin or virtue. Whichever one our mind is attracted to, we have to reap the results of that quality. Good deeds always produce good results and bad deeds always produce bad results.

literal meaning:

physique – body;
There is fear;
Dou – both;
Diagnosis – finally
5) Sweetest childish, sweetest public pride.
The water of the water, like milk boom. 5.

Tulsidas Ji says that the pride of good people is also erased by melodious words or sweet speech. As you pour a little cold water into the surging hot milk, it will calm down, not surging. Thus, there is the benefit of the sweetest word.

Tulasidasji says that through a soulful song or a sweet voice, the pride (ego) of even good persons is easily erased. It is similar to the act of adding cool water to boiling milk. When we add cool water to boiling milk, the milk which was bubbling and frothing, suddenly becomes calm. Such is the benefit of a touching song or a sweet voice.

literal meaning:

The body is erased;
Haughtiness – arrogance, pride;
Tensile - Little
seeth water - with cold water;
boom -
6) Go-money, gaj-dhan, Vaji-Dhan and Ratan-Dhan Khan.
When you have the satisfaction of wealth, all the money is the same. 6.

Tulsidas Ji says that human beings may have money like cow, money like yards (elephants), money of a horse and a repository of gems and wealth, it can never be satisfied. When he has the money of contentment, all other money is equal to dust or clay for him. That is, contentment is the greatest asset.

Tulasidasji says that even if a man has a wealth of corps, or a wealth of elephants, or a wealth of horses or even a wealth of gems and diamonds, he will never be satisfied. When a man comes to possess wealth in the form of satisfaction, then all other forms of wealth are just like dust or sand, i.e., they appear to be worthless. This means that satisfaction and happiness are the.. greatest wealth in the world.

literal meaning:

Vaji - Horse;
Dust.
7) Work, anger, item, greedy, barley, and mines in mind.
Taun Flame Pandit Moorkhau, Tulsi Alike | 7.

Tulsidas Ji says that as long as human beings have a disorder of lust, anger, pride, greed, etc., they are like fools even as scholars. Therefore, man should soon renounce work, anger, item and greed.

Tulasidasji says that as long as a person's mind is under the influence of lust (fancy), anger, arrogance, greed and other such bad qualities, till then even if he is a learned person, he is equal to a fool. Thus, the poet warns us that we must stay away from, or immediately abandon qualities like lust, anger, intoxication etc.

literal meaning:

barley - until;
Taum Flame – until then.
8. Not only the harsh, not the Nanne.
Don't go to Tulsi, Kanchan Barse Meh| 8.

That is, no matter how rich a person is, there is no hospitality when he is going to his house, he should not go there.

Tulasidasji says that upon visiting someone's house, if they are not happy to see us, or if we cannot see love reflected in their eyes, then we must never enter that house even if gold is showered in that house. This means that no matter how rich a person is, if we are not welcome in their house, or if guests are not honoured in their house, then we must never go there.

Tulasidasji says that we must never abandon the ways or traditions of our ancestors. It has been said that one must only marry a person who deserves or is worth marrying. Even as our enemies, we must only choose those who are worthy of us. Similarly, one must also love a person who is deserving or worthy of our love.

literal meaning:

When it came to – sometimes;
Worth – suitable, ok
10. Without a fast man, there is disobedience.
Agari Budhe As Rakhko, Apu Chheva Sab Koya | 10.

Tulsidas Ji says that a man of the world is certainly insulted. Therefore, every human being should preserve his fast, self-esteem. Just as the fire is extinguished, it becomes easier not only to touch the ashes, but also to trample the people. It is not easy to touch the burning fire. Similarly, it is easy to insult a fast man, but no one can insult a person with a sharp will.

Tulasidasji says that in this world it is certain that a person without knowledge and education will be insulted. It becomes quite easy to touch the ashes when the fire is extinguished. In fact, the ashes are also trampled upon by people. The same fire, before it is extinguished, is not so easy to touch. In the same manner, an uneducated person is easy to insult, but no one can insult an enlightened person.

literal meaning:

Fast – Tejas, Swabhiman, Kirti;
Aashashi – must;
Disobedience – disrespect, humiliation.
